For today's (day 7) part two, I "cheated" :)

My program simply accumulates the weights and calculates level
in the structure (not in a recursive manner!), then outputs
the resulting values sorted by level and supporter.

By following the node with difference, it was easy to eyeball
the one that needed to be changed.


./a.out <data | less

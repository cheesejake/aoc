For today's (day 7) part two, I "cheated" :)

My program simply accumulates the weights and calculates level
in the structure (not in a recursive manner!), then outputs
the resulting values.

By sorting the output by level and name (I could easily do
that within the code, but I had "wasted" too much time already),
then following the node with difference, it was easy to eyeball
the one that needed to be changed.


./a.out <data | sort -k 7,9 | less


Maybe next version I'll code the sorting and just
keep the eyeballing as "cheating".

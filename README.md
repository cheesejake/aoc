# aDventOfCode ( aoc )

My C (2015, 2017, 2019) and Forth (2018) solutions
for puzzles in Advent of Code ( http://adventodcode.com/ ).

Unless otherwise noted ... (see eg 2015/day04)
Every letter or symbol in my code comes from my keyboard
(directly or indirectly). There's no copy/paste of someone else code.
There will be copy/paste of my own code.
If I need help with some data structure or algorithm, I will read
the description and come up with my own implementation.
